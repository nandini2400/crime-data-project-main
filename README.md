**Crime and Traffic Data Analysis**
This project merges crime and traffic data from 2020 to the present to analyze potential correlations between high-traffic areas and crime occurrences. We preprocess, merge, analyze, and visualize the data to derive insights into monthly and hourly crime trends, hotspots, and more.

Dataset Description
Crime Dataset: Contains records of crimes from 2020 to the present. Key columns include:

DR_NO: Unique identifier for crime incidents
DATE_OCC: Date of the crime occurrence
TIME_OCC: Time of the crime occurrence
LOCATION: Latitude and longitude information for the crime location
Traffic Dataset: Contains data on New York City motor vehicle collisions, including details on collision date, time, and location. Key columns include:

COLLISION_ID: Unique identifier for traffic incidents
CRASH_DATE: Date of the traffic incident
CRASH_TIME: Time of the traffic incident
LAT, LON: Latitude and longitude information for collision locations
Data Processing and Cleaning
Step 1: Load and Explore Data
Load both datasets, check the first few rows, and inspect column names, data types, and any unique identifiers.
Identify and handle missing values:
Crime Dataset: Dropped rows with missing latitude/longitude values to maintain spatial accuracy.
Traffic Dataset: Converted crash_date to a datetime format, handling errors by converting invalid dates to NaT (Not a Time).
Step 2: Standardize Column Names
All column names are standardized to lowercase and replace spaces with underscores for consistency.
Step 3: Extract Date and Time Components
Extract date and time components from the crime and traffic datasets for easier merging and time-based analysis.
Derive columns like year, month, day, and hour for in-depth analysis.
Merging Datasets
To correlate traffic incidents with crime occurrences, we perform a merge based on approximate dates:

python
Copy code
# Convert date columns to datetime objects for approximate merging
traffic_data['crash_date'] = pd.to_datetime(traffic_data['crash_date'], errors='coerce')

# Merge datasets using pd.merge_asof() to join on nearest dates
merged_data = pd.merge_asof(
    crime_data.sort_values('date_occ'),
    traffic_data.sort_values('crash_date'),
    left_on='date_occ',
    right_on='crash_date',
    direction='nearest'
)
Explanation
Using pd.merge_asof allows for joining records that occur close in time rather than needing exact matches, which is beneficial when analyzing datasets where date records may be similar but not exact.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Monthly and Hourly Trends
Monthly Trends: Group by month and count occurrences to understand crime trends throughout the year.
Hourly Trends: Group by hour and count occurrences to determine peak hours for crime.
Crime Hotspots
Identify top locations for crime using location coordinates and visualize them on a geospatial map to pinpoint high-crime areas.
Installation and Requirements
To run this project, you need Python 3.x and the following libraries:

pandas for data processing
matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization
geopandas and plotly (optional) for geospatial mapping
Install these dependencies with:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn geopandas plotly
Visualization and Analysis
Use tools like Tableau or Power BI for creating interactive dashboards. Suggested visualizations:

Monthly Trends: Line chart showing monthly crime occurrences.
Hourly Trends: Heatmap showing crime distribution by day of the week and hour.
Hotspot Map: Geospatial map of top crime locations.

Summary
This repository provides tools for analyzing crime data in correlation with traffic incidents. With data cleaning, merging, and visualization techniques, we aim to uncover insights on crime patterns and potential influences of traffic activity.
